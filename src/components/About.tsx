            Our Story
          </h3>
          <p className="text-gray-400 text-base sm:text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Founded to serve modern skincare brands, Fresh Aura Media emerged from a simple insight: retention should drive growth, not just ads. Most brands focus on acquiring customers. We help you keep them. We believe that building long-term relationships with customers is what sets thriving brands apart from the rest.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-400 text-base sm:text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            By combining automated email flows, SMS touchpoints, and customer lifecycle strategies, we help skincare businesses turn their audience into a loyal, profitable community month after month. Our team focuses on data-driven decisions, creative messaging, and continuous optimization to ensure that your brand stays top of mind and drives repeat purchases.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-400 text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
            With every campaign, we aim not just for sales, but for meaningful connections between brands and their customers. Thatâ€™s the Fresh Aura difference.
